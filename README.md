## Why Accra?

Accra is my dream city because it represents a **blend of tradition and modern life**.
It is vibrant, welcoming, and full of cultural richness.
From the **Independence Arch** to **Makola Market** and the beautiful Atlantic coastline,
Accra symbolizes **heritage, resilience, and growth**.

Being the capital of Ghana, itâ€™s also a hub of opportunity, creativity, and innovation.
Living here gives me a sense of African identity and pride.
